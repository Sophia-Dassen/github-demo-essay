PROPOSAL

The object that I would like to base my paper on is “The Punished Suicide” located in the Museum of Pathological Anatomy in Padua 
which was made in 1863 by Lodovico Brunetti. It was made with the procedure of tannization invented by Lodovico himself, 
which was a way to preserve specimen; in this case, an eighteen-year-old girl who committed suicide. 

The museum classifies it under “artistic anatomy”, and in my essay, I would like to investigate how this scientific object 
can be seen as an artwork and how our perception of it would change if it was exhibited in an art museum (would we evaluate it more subjectively?).

The way this artwork was made can fit into an art historical context: classical busts; its base is a plaster cast; 
red wax was used to make it more dramatic; strong allegory behind it (God and the Church punished those who committed suicide; 
a normal burial would have been prohibited as well). It is also interesting to consider that the object had a preceding (human) biography.
