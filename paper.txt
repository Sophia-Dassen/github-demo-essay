The Punished Suicide as “artistic anatomy”

This section of the essay breaks down the term “artistic anatomy” into its two fundamental components: 
anatomy and art. After the definition of Brunetti’s tannization method, the manufacturing process of 
The Punished Suicide (Fig. 1.) will be explained; and finally, the object will be analysed with art historical approaches.

Brunetti and the tannization method

Lodovico Brunetti (1813–1899) is a prominent figure in the history of anatomy, who greatly contributed to the 
legacy of Padua of being the centre of medical studies.1 Brunetti was internationally acclaimed in his field; 
he was a member of various scientific societies across Europe, and he also received several honorary titles.2 
In 1855, he was appointed as chair of the new Institute of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Padua, 
which he held until 1887.3 With the aim of expanding learning opportunities for students, he established the 
Museum of Pathological Anatomy in Padua in the early 1870s.4 This museum was the stage where his tannization 
experiments unfolded: he enriched the collection with dozens of preparations, one of them being The Punished Suicide. 

Brunetti’s tannization method was appraised for its ability to perfectly maintain the proportions and texture of 
the specimen.5 The process consisted of four steps: “blood and fat removal from the organ by flushing the vessels 
with water; injection of tannic acid into the now cleaned vessels; and drying the organ with hot compressed air.”6 
Brunetti himself divided the development of this method into four periods, the first of which he called “external 
and artistic preparation”, in other words, “artistic anatomy”.7 

Artistic anatomy is a curious term since it has two separate, yet intermingled traditions in the fields of art 
and science. In the field of art, the term originated with Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo, 
who “were doing vastly more dissection and were far more familiar with the structure of the body than were anatomists.”8 
Although these artists utilized their anatomical knowledge for their artistic production, some claim that they can be 
considered the founders of anatomy – especially Leonardo, who “placed art in the service of anatomy”.9 Meanwhile, in 
a medical, anatomical and anatomical-pathological context, artistic anatomy “concerns preparations that have been made 
by combining medical-didactic and aesthetic purposes.”10 This is the category to which The Punished Suicide belongs. 

The making of “La Suicida Punita”

The Punished Suicide is the taxidermy of an eighteen-year-old woman, “who was found drowned on the banks of the river 
that ran beside the rear facade of the Hospital “Giustinianeo” close to the Institute of Pathological Anatomy,.”11 
Her body was sent to Brunetti, who was to perform the autopsy.12 There is a lack of logical reasoning behind the decision 
to experiment on the woman’s corpse after the autopsy had been completed; nevertheless, Brunetti preserved part of the 
corpse in a bust-form in the following way: 
During the autopsy, Brunetti made a plaster cast of the girl’s face and upper bust. After this, he peeled away the skin 
from her face and neck, scoured the flesh with sulfuric ether and then treated it with tannic acid to preserve it from 
putrefaction. He then re-applied the tissue over the plaster cast, to reproduce girl’s features, adding glass eyes and 
plaster ears to complete the taxidermy, covering her shoulders with a light lace fabric.13

However, it was impossible to repair certain gashes on the woman’s skin – especially on the eyelid – which were caused 
by the hooks that were used to recover the body from the water.14 Therefore, Brunetti decided to attach decoration to 
it in order to hide these imperfections. He applied two tree branches with moss to the base of the structure, then placed 
four twisting serpents on them which are positioned in a way that they seem to attack and devour the woman’s face; and 
this is reinforced by the final touch of dripping red wax which resembles blood. The resulting composition is an allegory 
for the punishment that one receives in hell for committing suicide, – as the title suggests – which was a religious dogma 
of the Roman Catholic Church.15 These decorations and the allegorical character are what make The Punished Suicide into an 
“artistic anatomy”, which can further be explored through art historical approaches.
