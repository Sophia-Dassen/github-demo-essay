Introduction

Among dozens of rarities, visitors of the Museum of Pathological Anatomy in Padua can encounter a frightening, 
yet curious object titled “The Punished Suicide”. It is the preserved bust of a young woman with added 
allegorical decorations, which was created by Lodovico Brunetti in 1863 with his own method called tannization. 
This peculiar object belongs to the category of “artistic anatomy”, as it is on the threshold between art and 
science, which makes its reception rather complicated. This essay aims to analyse “The Punished Suicide” through 
art historical approaches; moreover, to assess whether an artistic or a scientific museological context would suit 
it more.
