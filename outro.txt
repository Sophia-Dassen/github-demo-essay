Conclusion

The Punished Suicide is, metaphorically speaking, a thing that talks. “Like seeds around which an elaborate crystal 
can suddenly congeal, things in a supersaturated cultural solution can crystallize ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. 
These thickenings of significance are one way that things can be made to talk.”1 The cultural biography of The Punished 
Suicide reflects on the supersaturated cultural solution of the nineteenth century; therefore, it is an excellent source 
of socio-cultural knowledge. Also, like many other things that talk, The Punished Suicide is a chimera, a composite of 
different kinds. “Art and nature, persons and things, objective and subjective are somehow brought together in these things, 
and the fusion results in considerable blurring of outlines.”2 In the case of Brunetti’s creation, the outlines between art 
and science art blurred: it could be considered an artwork in principle, but fundamentally it is an anatomical taxidermy. 
What is certain, is that no matter the museological context, The Punished Suicide will always be a thing that talks.
